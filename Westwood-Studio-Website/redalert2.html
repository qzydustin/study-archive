            In Red Alert 2, the Soviet Union led by Joseph Stalin tried to conquer Europe, but was defeated by the
            Allies and his army was destroyed. Fearing that the regime change would lead to large-scale unrest in the
            Soviet Union, the victorious Allies installed Alexander Romanov, a distant relative of
            Tsar Nicholas II, as a pseudo-Soviet prime minister. Romanov initially requested to replace the Allies,
            although he formed a Soviet army for "defense purposes" and intended to invade the United States. The
            storyline of the game began in 1972, when the USSR suddenly invaded the United States on a large scale, the
            armed forces were completely caught by surprise, Soviet aircraft, naval ships, amphibious forces and
            paratroopers all entered the east and west coasts, and most Soviet ground forces entered through Mexico. ,
            The third world war. Attempts to retaliate against the use of nuclear missiles, but the Iranian leader Yuri
            Soviet psychological unit and Prime Minister Romanov's top adviser used his mind control to
            manipulate the staff responsible for launching the warhead and left it in the silo to explode . Within a few
            hours, the United States had been occupied by Soviet troops. Players play the role of American commanders.
            General Ben Cavill's mission is to defend the United States, or the Soviet commander will lead Prime
            Minister Romanov's invasion.
