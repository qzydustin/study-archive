        <h1>A critique from my client.</h1>
        <p> Zhenyu Qi made a website about Westwood Studios. He introduces us the Red Alert video games. Overall, he
            did a good job. We can see there are awesome images, videos and audios on the website. Also, I got much
            info from the context. Personally, Red Alert is my childhood memory and I think it is a great idea to
            design this website. If there are more images or background colors, it will be perfect.</p>
