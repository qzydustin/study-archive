            In "Command and Conquer: Yuri's Revenge", the story begins with the assumption that the Allies won in Red
            Alert 2. The game began with the DEFCON 2 status announced by the White House, as Yuri, the former head of
            spiritual power in the Soviet Union, planned to control the world through thought control by activating a
            secretly established network of spiritual rulers around the world. The United States launched an air strike
            on Alcatraz's “spiritual ruler”. Despite the heavy casualties, the equipment was turned off after the power
            plant was destroyed. But Yuri activated other people, and others on Earth soon succumbed to Yuri's thought
            control.
